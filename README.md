# Computer_Vision_Based_Waste_Identifier
A computer vision-based waste identifier utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately classify and sort waste. Its key aspects include:

**1. Image Capture:** Utilizing cameras or input devices to capture images of waste items.

**2. Preprocessing:** Enhancing image quality, removing noise, and standardizing the dataset.

**3. Feature Extraction:** Extracting relevant features from waste images for classification.

**4. Classification Model:** Training machine learning models to identify and categorize different types of waste.

**5. Real-time Identification:** Deploying the system to identify waste items in real-time, facilitating efficient waste management and recycling processes.
